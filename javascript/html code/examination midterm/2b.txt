The include and require statements are identical, except upon failure:

1a.require will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script
1b.include will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue

2a.Use require when the file is required by the application.
2b.Use include when the file is not required and application should continue when file is not found.
