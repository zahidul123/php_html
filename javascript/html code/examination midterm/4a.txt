Inheritance: 
Inheritance is a concept in object oriented programming. With the help of inheritance we can get all property and method of one class in another class. 

Example of php inheritance:-
class Animal { 
public $name;
 public function Greet()
 {
 return "Hello, I'm some sort of animal and my name is " . $this->name; } 
}
class Dog extends Animal {
 public function Greet()
 { return "Hello, I'm a dog and my name is " . $this->name; }
 }
